# Getting Started with my First React Multi-page Website

This project was created using React, it is a simple multi-page website which gives basic information about a company and the services they offer. I used React to build the website, because of it's quick, fast and efficient way of changing between pages.

### My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I learnt how to use React.Js and React Router in routing between pages 

### Continued development

- I would continue focusing and building my React knowledge and skills, so has to be able to build more complex react based applications.
- I would also learn Next.js and Tailwind CSS, so has to be able to build more proficient and effective react based applications.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand how to properly build and predeploy my React website. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
